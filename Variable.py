#This file explains the full process to declare and use Variables in Python.

"""
To declare a variable, first give it a name.
There are some rules to name a variable:
    1. A variable name can only contain Alphabets, Numbers and Underscore(_).
    2. A variable name can start with Alphabets and Underscore only.
    3. No special chareacters other than underscore can be used in a variable name.
    
After deciding a name, lets say name_1, you need to put the assignment operator or an equal to sign(=).

After that, you need to give the variable a value. It can be an Integer, Float, String, etc.

name_1 = "Abhishek Tiwari" # The variable name_1 will hold the string "Abhishek Tiwari".
